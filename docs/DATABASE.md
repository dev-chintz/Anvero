# Data Model

The model will be deployed via migrations after framework selection, but a common data language already applies.

| Entity | Role | Key Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `integration` | configured data source | `provider`, `external_account_id`, `status` |
| `order` | order in Anvero | `id`, `integration_id`, `external_id`, `status`, `ordered_at`, `currency` |
| `order_item` | order item | `order_id`, `sku`, `name`, `quantity`, `unit_price` |
| `customer` | buyer | `name`, `email`, `phone` |
| `address` | shipping or invoice address | `order_id`, `type`, address data |
| `shipment` | shipment | `order_id`, `carrier`, `tracking_number`, `status` |
| `order_status_history` | status audit | `order_id`, `from_status`, `to_status`, `changed_at` |

`external_id` is unique only within an integration. Amounts are stored as decimal values, never as `float`. Integration access credentials do not go to repositories or logs.
